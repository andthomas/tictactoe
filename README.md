## What is tic tac toe?

Tic tac toe, also known as naughts and crosses, is traditionally a paper and pencil game for two players. Tic tac toe can be traced back to ancient Egypt. An early variation of the game was also played in the Roman Empire (called terni lapilli), and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three. In 1952, tic tac toe was developed by British computer scientist Alexander Douglas as OXO for the EDSAC computer, and became one of the first known video games.

## What are the rules?
Players are assigned an x or and o. Then, players take it in turn to place their piece on a 3x3 grid. The first person to get three in a line in either the rows, columns or diagonals is the winner.
